            <p>Hello, my name is Lucas Eduardo Feliciana, and I live in Naperville, Illinois. I am a
                highly
                motivated individual with a strong passion for learning and personal growth. I have
                a
                particular
                interest in soccer, both as a player and as a spectator. In my free time, I am
                passionate about
                spending quality time with my wife, watching series together, exploring restaurants,
                and
                having long
                conversations about our future and shared goals.
                I am currently studying Software Development and am highly enthusiastic about
                expanding
                my technical
                knowledge and applying it in practical, real-world scenarios. I enjoy learning new
                technologies,
                solving problems, and challenging myself to improve continuously. My goal is to grow
                both
                professionally and personally, building a solid career in the technology field while
                contributing
                positively through my skills, creativity, and dedication..
            </p>
