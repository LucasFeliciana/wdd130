        <p>Hello, my name is
            Lucas Eduardo Feliciana, and I live in Naperville, Illinois. I am a
            highly
            motivated individual with a strong passion for learning and personal growth. I have a
            particular interest in soccer, both as a player and as a spectator. I am currently
            studying Software Development and am highly enthusiastic about expanding my knowledge
            and applying it in practice. My goal is to continuously develop my skills while enjoying
            the learning process and pursuing a career in a field I have aspired to for many years.
        </p>
